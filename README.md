# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-movie-reviews-dataset

This is a walkthrough through the sentiment analysis process.
I used the IMDB dataset containing 50,0000 movie reviews with the sentiments(either positive or negative)
The goal is to use the data to build a classification model that can group new instances(reviews) as either positive or negative.
